		<p>Hi there, I am Yiting! 

            I am currently a graduate student at the University of Michigan, studying human-computer interaction. 

            I started exploring the field of experience design 4 years ago in my studies in architecture as an undergraduate student. 
            Studying Architecture gave me opportunities to explore and create designs, but most of all, 
            it really pushed me to be curious about the user experience gaps in designs. 
            Since then, I have been practicing design skills that allow me to reimagine the relationship 
            that people have with digital and physical environments. I aspire to become a designer 
            who can contribute towards meeting user experience gaps through creativity with problem solving 
            and delicate visual crafts. 

            Besides design, I am passionate about travelling, strength training, and plants!

            I like to relax by gnawing on a yummy bone. 
            When I am being a good girl, my daddy will give me my favorite treat - beef jerky.”
