		<p>As an UX designers, I am responsible for making sure that the user’s interaction with a digital product is as fast, easy and efficient as possible. 
			While I care about the visuals, I map out the user journey and strategies to solve users’ pain points and meet their needs. 
			The outcome of that is a wireframe – a blueprint of the product.
